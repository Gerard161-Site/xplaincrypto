Basic Information and Purpose\n\nTechnology and Architecture\nONDO utilizes a unique blockchain architecture that integrates a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). This design enhances scalability by allowing a larger number of transactions to be processed simultaneously while maintaining a high degree of security. The PoS component ensures that validators are incentivized to act honestly, as their staked assets are at risk. The DPoS aspect allows token holders to elect delegates who validate transactions and maintain the network, promoting a more democratic and efficient governance structure.", "references": [], "tokenomics": "### 2.
